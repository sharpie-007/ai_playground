                    <p class="text-justify">  We hear about AI everywhere, and every time it gets mentioned, the reality, and fiction behind 
                        what AI is and could be gets a little more blurry. Terms can be confusing (Computer Vision, Object Detection, 
                        Natural Language Detection, Narrow AI, General AI, etc) and are often intermingled and mixed without consideration. 
                        This makes it very difficult for people who aren't in the field, but are required to be able to procure, implement, 
                        and ultimately move their businesses in the direction of Artificial Intelligence. <strong>How might we </strong>
                        desmystify AI in an engaging, 
                        simple, and powerful way so that non Data Science profesisonals can grasp it's potential and it's limits?</p>

                        <div class="display-4 lead text-center">THE AI PLAYGROUND</div> <br/>
                        <p class="text-justify">I decided that using Jupyter Notebooks, while an enormous leap forward from showing people 
                            source code and or command line interfaces, wouldn't be an impactful way to let people interact with trained 
                            classifiers. I decided instead to build out a couple of demonstration capabilities that regular users could interact 
                            with. This way a user could experience some of the benefits, advantages, drawbacks, and shortcomings of some of 
                            applied machine learning. I broke this down into three demonstrations.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Static Image Object Detection (Using a pre-trained, open source model)</li>
                                <li>Video Based Object Detection (Using a pre-trained, open source model)</li>
                                <li>Binary Text Classification (including all source code to prepare and train a Keras Model)</li>
                            </ol>
                                
                                I chose these three demonstrations because Computer Vision gets a lot of attention, and it's visually very compelling 
                                to interact with, and text classification because Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a passion of mine and I want to 
                                shine more light on the issues around cyber bullying and the potential things we can do to limit it using more advanced 
                                techniques. <br/><br/>
                                
                                In each demonstration, the user will see some of the positives (detecting subversive speech, blurry objects) and 
                                negatives (unable to detect sarcasm, limited vocabulary, missing objects, misclassification) of using each model. 
                                Again, the intent is to demystify the process somewhat.<br/><br/>
                                
                                N.B., the video based object detection demo is non-interactive. Having a dynamic one (i.e. user uploaded videos), 
                                would have been too costly to deploy (both in compute and in monetary terms).</p><br/>
