# Background and Description

## Problem Description

We hear about AI everywhere, and every time it gets mentioned, the reality, and fiction behind what AI is and could be gets a little more blurry. Terms can be confusing (Computer Vision, Object Detection, Natural Language Detection, Narrow AI, General AI, etc) and are often intermingled and mixed without consideration. This makes it very difficult for people who aren't in the field, but are required to be able to procure, implement, and ultimately move their businesses in the direction of Artificial Intelligence. How might we desmystify AI in an engaging, simple, and powerful way so that non Data Science profesisonals can grasp it's potential and it's limits?

## My Solution, the AI Playground.

I decided that using Jupyter Notebooks, while an enormous leap forward from showing people source code and or command line interfaces, wouldn't be an impactful way to let people interact with trained classifiers. I decided instead to build out a couple of demonstration capabilities that regular users could interact with. This way a user could experience some of the benefits, advantages, drawbacks, and shortcomings of some of applied machine learning.



## A word on YOLOv3
